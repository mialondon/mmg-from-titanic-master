This is a version of Scott Nix's Titanic WordPress theme, which is in turn built on top of his Responsive Base theme built on the Thematic Theme Framework. 

This version has been adapted for use with the MMG plugins which use WordPress to host crowdsourcing metadata games for museums, libraries and archives.

You can find out more about the original theme at http://scottnix.com/themes/titanic/ and http://scottnix.com/titanic-child-theme-for-thematic/
